# Line Hyper-eXpander

The LHX is dual:

- it is a tool to do some work
- it is a sandbox to learn how to program in the Haskell language

## Idea

The central idea is to make possible to transform some text line-by-line using a simple templating language: rename a group of files, generate HTML lists and tables, etc.
